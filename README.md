# Development Scripts

A collection of software for CLI tools and utilities that I like.

## Setup

> **[WARNING]** <br /> This invokes a shell script for running the setup. You can review what the script does on GitHub. NEVER run a script blindly without making sure you trust it.

```bash
gh repo clone jgttech/dev-scripts ${HOME}/.scripts;
echo "source \"\${HOME}/.scripts/zsh.sh\"" >> ${HOME}/.zshrc;
```
